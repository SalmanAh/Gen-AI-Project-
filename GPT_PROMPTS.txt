TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
================================================================================

The following aspects were implemented by the team with AI assistance for research:

1. **System Architecture**: Designed modular pipeline with separate components for
   audio analysis, scene classification, and image generation.

2. **Model Integration**: Integrated CLAP and SDXL models with custom preprocessing
   and postprocessing pipelines.

3. **Scene Taxonomy**: Developed comprehensive 180+ category system organized by
   domain (nature, urban, indoor, etc.) with detailed scene descriptions.

4. **Memory Optimization**: Implemented FP16 precision, CPU offloading, VAE slicing
   to run SDXL on 8GB GPU.

5. **API Design**: Created RESTful endpoints with proper error handling, validation,
   and response formatting.

   strategies for compatibility.

7. **Prompt Enhancement**: Developed system to convert audio labels into detailed
   scene descriptions optimized for image generation.

PROMPT ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES DEMONSTRATED
================================================================================

1. **Research-Oriented Queries**: Asked for comparisons, trade-offs, and best practices
   rather than direct implementation.

2. **Constraint Specification**: Clearly defined hardware limits (8GB GPU), performance
   requirements (30-40s generation), and quality targets (photorealistic).

3. **Iterative Refinement**: Started with broad questions, then drilled down into
   specific technical details based on implementation needs.

4. **Problem Decomposition**: Broke complex audio-to-image pipeline into manageable
   components (audio loading, classification, prompt generation, image synthesis).

5. **Error-Driven Learning**: Used debugging prompts to understand root causes and
   explore alternative solutions.

6. **Comparative Analysis**: Asked for model comparisons to make informed decisions
   (CLAP vs AudioCLIP, SDXL vs SD 2.1).
